How to remove protected apps, such as News, Stocks, and Home from a Mojave macOS installation

### Special thanks to [9define](https://github.com/9define) for suggesting this workaround! :) 

## About
Have you upgraded to Majave on your mac and object to sponsored apps? Refuse to be pushed Apple's liberal News or to be shilled Apple's Home ecosystem of products? Hate the XNU kernel? Don't want to disable SIP just to nuke a few apps?

## Problem

## Reasons

* Stocks -- Streams CNBC echonomic news, which is a biased news outlet.
* News -- Multiple liberal sources. Biased. Little to no unfiltered conservative representation. Shills Apple products.
* Home -- Forces users to buy products that pay Apple for the priviledge of being compatible with macOS and iOS.
